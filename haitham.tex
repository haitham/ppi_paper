\section{Introduction} 

Analysis of protein-protein interactions has a growing potential of
providing a better understanding about collective protein function and cellular machinery.
Such interactions can be modeled as a protein interaction network; that is a
weighted graph where each node represents a protein and each edge represents an
interaction between a pair of proteins, with a weight representing the level of
confidence that this interaction truly exists. Such a structure allows easier
extraction of hidden information due to the analogy with well-known graph
problems.

An important aspect of the analysis of protein interaction networks
is detecting signaling pathways. A signaling pathway is a series of proteins in
which each protein signals its successor to transmit some biological
information through their interaction. Signaling pathways can be viewed as
simple paths in protein interaction networks\cite{kelley}. Given a confidence
value for each interaction, we can assign an overall confidence value for the existence
of a pathway simply by multiplying the confidence values of its constituting
interactions. An optimal pathway is one with the highest confidence value. To
work in an additive framework, edge weights can be assigned logarithmic values
of the original interaction confidence.

\paragraph{Problem} Consider a set $V$ of nodes denoting proteins, and a
probability value $p(u, v)$ denoting interaction confidence for each $u, v \in
V$. A set of undirected weighted edges $E$ can be obtained by adding an edge for
each pair $(u, v)$ with $p(u, v) > 0$, and assigning it a weight $w(p, v) =
-$log[$p(u, v)$]. Now consider the undirected weighted graph $G = (V, E, w)$
representing the protein interaction network, and a set of start nodes $S \in
V$. For each $v \in V$, we want to find a minimum-weight simple path of length
$m$, starting at any node $s \in S$ and ending at $v$. The traveling-salesman
problem is polynomial-time reducible to this problem; therefore it is
NP-hard\cite{scott}.

Scott et al. presented a method for detecting pathways\cite{scott} using a
generic technique devised by Alon et al. called
\textit{color-coding}\cite{alon}. The basic idea of this method is to randomly
assign each node in the graph one of $m$ different colors, and search for an
optimal pathway in the restricted domain of colorful pathways. A pathway is
considered colorful if and only if all of its nodes are different in color from
each other. This process is repeated for several iterations until reaching a
given level of confidence that the unknown optimal pathway was among the
colorful ones at some instance. This confidence level builds up with each
iteration by calculating a probability value that an optimal path is indeed
colorful in this iteration. This \textit{success probability} value depends
solely on the pathway length $m$ and doesn’t capitalize on available
information like the network topology and color assignment.

G{\"u}lsoy et al. presented an enhanced color-coding technique called
\textit{k-hop coloring}\cite{gulsoy}. In essence, k-hop coloring makes use of
knowing the network topology and the node colors to assign the network a
maximal value $k$ such that the network is k-hop colorable. A colored network is
k-hop colorable if the shortest path between any pair of same-color nodes is
more than $k$ hops in length. This additional piece of information allows for
higher success probability in each iteration, with a higher $k$ value resulting
in a higher success probability. However, an obvious limitation is that the
subnetworks with higher level of connectivity diminishe the $k$ value assigned
to the whole network. For example, a network containing a clique of size $m$
cannot be colored with ($m-1$)-hop coloring using $m$ colors\cite{gulsoy}.

\paragraph{Contribution} Our motivation comes from the need for a deeper
understanding of the relation between network topology, random color assignment
and success probability. We study the possibility of assigning $k$ values to
nodes on an individual basis instead of a single $k$ value for the whole
network. We also study how this reflects on the resulting success probability
for each iteration. We examine the idea that a pathway whose nodes are assigned
different $k$ values should result in a higher success probability than if we
only consider the minimum of these $k$ values for all nodes. We present a new
method for detecting signaling pathways in protein interaction networks using an
enhanced k-hop coloring technique based on these findings.

We provide validation experiments to test the biological significance of our
results. We use \textit{weight p-value} and \textit{functional enrichment} as
validation measures. We also compare the performance of our method against the
one presented by Scott et al.\cite{scott} with respect to how fast our method
reaches a given confidence level as opposed to theirs.

The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 discusses the
background and related work. Section 3 explains how to obtain a tighter bound on
success probability and describes our enhanced k-hop coloring method. Section 4
shows the experiments performed and their results. Section 5 is the conclusion
of the paper.


\section{Background}



\section{Methods}

\subsection{Term Definition and Problem Formulation}
Here we define the terms we commonly use like: coloring instance, k-value
configuration, ..etc. Then we accurately define the problem of finding signaling
pathways in PPI networks.

\subsection{Success Probability: a Tighter Bound}
Here we should explain the calculation of success probability, how the number
of possible colorings for the optimal path is its key factor, and how obtaining
a tighter (smaller) bound on it results in a tighter bound on success
probability, and hence a better result. We then explain our notion of k-value
configuration and how we calculate this bound from it. We explain the lattice
structure and the subset relation between k-value configurations.

\subsection{Method: Enhanced k-hop Coloring}
Here we detail our method. We start by asserting that we have no knowledge about
the optimal path, but we use the local optimal as a replacement and
experimentally test the correctness of this approach. Then we explain the
algorithm in detail.

\section{Experiments}

\subsection{Datasets}
Here we list the datasets used in experiments. I think we can use the MINT
datasets for multiple organisms.

\subsection{Validation Experiments}
Here we list the validation experiments we did and their results. I think we
should do some validation experiments similar to those done in Sharan's paper,
using weight p-value and functional enrichment as validitiy measures.

\subsubsection{Validation using Weight p-value}
For each dataset we use, we should obtain the 99 percent confidence optimal
pathway and compare it with optimal pathways obtained we obtain from random
networks. We generate random networks by shuffling edges of the original
network. The weight p-value is the percentage of cases where the algorithm
produces a more optimal pathway when run on one of these random networks.

\subsubsection{Validation using Functional Enrichment}
 For each dataset, we we obtain the 99 percent confidence optimal pathway and
 test its functional enrichment. For each GO term appearing on the dataset
 proteins, we count the total number of proteins annotated by it and the
 number of proteins in the resulting pathway annotated by it. We use these
 numbers, along with the total number of proteins and the number of proteins in
 the pathway, as parameters for a hypergeometric test (I still have to develop
 further understanding about the details of this test). The maximum enrichment
 value for any of the tested GO terms gives us the final functional enrichment
 p-value.

\subsection{Comparison with Sharan}
This is just a temporary title for this subsection, I'm not very sure what to
name it.

\paragraph{}
We measure the time and number of iterations needed by our method to obtain
70\%, 90\% and 99\% confidence pathways of lengths 6, 7, 8 and 9 nodes. We
compare these numbers against the ones by Sharan's method for the same cases.

\paragraph{}
We run our method for 500 iterations and measure the incremental success
probabilty against iteration number. We do this experiment many times take the
average curve. We do the same experiment using Sharan's method and obtain a
second curve. We also measure the average practical success probability, which
is the observed probability that the DP algorithm finds the optimal solution in
a certain iteration or before it. We compare the three curves targetting two
conclusions: (1) our method is experimentally solid because our calculated
success probabiilities are lower than the observed ones; and (2) our method
outperforms Sharan's method.

\section{Conclusion}
Here goes the conclusion.
